Hi, I'm Amelia McNamara. I'm an assistant professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. I tweet at AmeliaMN, which is a double entendre because my last name is McNamara and I live in Minnesota. I just tweeted a link to these slides if you want to follow along.

I'm going to be talking about iteration at two different levels.

# Iteration in R

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## for loop approach (inefficient!)
```{r badapproach, eval=FALSE}
penguins$bill_length_in <- NA
for (i in 1:dim(penguins)[1]) {
  penguins$bill_length_in[i] <- penguins$bill_length_mm[i] / 25.4
  }
```

## vectorized approach 
```{r}
penguins$bill_length_in <- penguins$bill_length_mm / 25.4
```

???

As you may already know, traditional control structures like for-loops can be very inefficient in R. Vectorized operations avoid the copy-on-modify issue, and are overall less work for you as the programmer!

# The apply() family of functions

```{r}
mean(penguins$body_mass_g[penguins$species == "Adelie"], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(penguins$body_mass_g[penguins$species == "Chinstrap"], na.rm = TRUE)
mean(penguins$body_mass_g[penguins$species == "Gentoo"], na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
tapply(penguins$body_mass_g, penguins$species, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

???
I grabbed this example from my recent useR! talk. We can avoid copying and pasting by using an apply() function, but I can never remember the syntax.

# tidyverse solution

```{r}
library(dplyr)
penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This solution is much easier for me, cognitively.

# Scraping

- GitHub
- Facebook

???

I'd like to talk to you about two scraping projects I've done recently. 

---
# Counting commits 

The first project relates to a promise I made my students in Spring 2019. GitHub had sent me some swag to distribute to students, including two t-shirt redemption codes. 

> I'll give a t-shirt to the student with the most commits over the semester in each section.
> - Me (without thinking about how hard that might be)

## One approach (that I didn't use)

- For each student, use the GitHub API to determine all repositories they committed to
- For each repository, use the API to determine the number of commits in that repository
- Total all commits for each student by adding up commits from each repository they committed to

## Issues

- Seemed like a lot of levels of iteration to deal with
- If a student committed to an active repo, their count would be artificially inflated
- Students worked in groups on repos

Scraping! 

Initially, I was just going to grab that number where it says "411 contributions in the last year." 

---

![](img/GitHubSource1.png)

???

If you want to look at the HTML code of a web page, you can View Source. Here's where that 411 comes from

---
# Getting set up to scrape
```{r}
roster <- tibble(url = c("https://github.com/AmeliaMN",
                         "https://github.com/hglanz",
                         "https://github.com/hardin47",
                        "https://github.com/nicholasjhorton"))
```

```{r}
library(rvest)

session <- html_session("https://github.com")
```

.footnote[[Counting commits and peer code review](https://teachdatascience.com/countingcommits/), a post by me on the [Teach Data Science blog](https://teachdatascience.com)
]

???
I'm picking on the folks who run the Teach Data Science blog. 

The session isn't actually necessary now, but it will be later.

---
# Scraping the 411
```{r}
library(readr)

commits <- function(url, session) {
  session %>%
    jump_to(url) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("h2.f4.text-normal.mb-2") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    # gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$", "", .) %>% # don't need this!
    pluck(2) %>%
    parse_number()
}
```

.footnote[[Counting commits and peer code review](https://teachdatascience.com/countingcommits/), a post by me on the [Teach Data Science blog](https://teachdatascience.com)
]

???

Take a session, then jump to a url, then read the HTML, then select the HTML nodes that match that selector (selector gadget!), then extract the text, then take the second element and parse the number. 

This is a function that finds that number.

# Iterating over URLs

```{r}
library(purrr)

roster <- roster %>% 
  mutate(commits = map_dbl(url, commits, session = session)) 
```

Charlotte Wickham helped me with this code.

# Problems

- I didn't say I was giving the t-shirt to the person with the most commits in the last year, I said in the time period of the semester
- Many of my students' commits were on private GitHub repos (visible to me, because of how they were set up in GitHub classroom)

# An aside
![](img/GitHubPreferences.png)

???
This is just an aside, but I believe the default is to have private contributions not counted on your profile. I've changed this preference myself, because I want more of those green boxes! 

My students hadn't done this, so I needed to be logged in to see their "true" commit counts.

---

![](img/GitHubProfileGreenBlocks.png)
???

Instead, I decided to grab those green blocks, which actually have data attached to them! 

---

![](img/GitHubSource2.png)

???
Check it out! They have the dates and number of commits


---
# Here we go again

```{r}
commits_by_date <- function(url, session){
  session %>%
    jump_to(url) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("rect.day") %>%
    html_attrs() %>%
    map_dfr(as.list) %>% 
    select(count = `data-count`, date = `data-date`) %>% 
    mutate(
      date = parse_date(date),
      count = parse_number(count),
      )
}
```

.footnote[[Counting commits and peer code review](https://teachdatascience.com/countingcommits/), a post by me on the [Teach Data Science blog](https://teachdatascience.com)

This gets the data from the green boxes. Again, refactored by Charlotte.

# Iterating over URLs

```{r}

roster %>%
  mutate(by_date = map(url, commits_by_date, session = session)) %>%
  unnest(cols = c(by_date)) %>%
  filter(date > as.Date("2020-02-04"), date < as.Date("2020-05-24")) %>% #changed the dates to 2020
  group_by(url) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))
```

# One more wrinkle-- authenticating 

```{r}
session <- html_session("https://github.com/login")

login <- session %>%
  html_node("form") %>%
  html_form() %>%
  set_values(login = "YourGitHubUsername", password = "SuperSecureP@ssw0rd")


github <- session %>%
  submit_form(login, submit = "commit") %>%
  read_html()
```

.footnote[[Counting commits and peer code review](https://teachdatascience.com/countingcommits/), a post by me on the [Teach Data Science blog](https://teachdatascience.com)

???

Like in the blog post, I'm not going to run this here, because I'm not giving you my GitHub password! 

---
# Iterating 😱

```{r, eval=FALSE}
count <- c()
for (i in 1:dim(roster)[1]){
  tmp <- session %>%
    jump_to(roster$url[i]) %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes("rect.day") %>%
    html_attrs() %>%
    map(`[`, c("data-count", "data-date")) %>%
    tibble() %>%
    unnest()  %>%
    mutate(what = rep(c("count", "date"), times=370)) %>%
    mutate(which = rep(1:370, each = 2)) %>% 
    rename(values=".") %>%
    spread(key = "what", value = "values") %>% 
    filter(date > "2019-02-04") %>% 
    mutate(count = parse_number(count)) %>%
    summarise(total = sum(count))
  count[i] <- pull(tmp)
  print(".")
}
```

???

Earlier, I was showing you the code that Charlotte helped me refactor. This was what I actually used when I needed to figure out who won the t-shirt. This code is uuuugly. And slow. 

Perfect code doesn't flow out of my (or any programmer's) fingers. If you don't succeed, try try again.

# Facebook

In October 2019, I finally deleted my Facebook account. I had been a user since I got a college email address in 2006, and had looked at it multiple times a day, every day, in the intervening years. 

But, Facebook has been a bad actor when it comes to using data and protecting peoples' rights. Some of these issues are listed in [my blog post](https://www.amelia.mn/blog/misc/2019/12/29/Deleting-Facebook.html), although Facebook has just continued to do bad things. 

- [Facebook’s own civil rights auditors say its policy decisions are a ‘tremendous setback’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/08/facebook-civil-rights-audit/)

# Getting data from Facebook

Facebook actually makes it pretty easy to get a lot of your data. You can choose `.json` or `.html` formats. I ended up grabbing both, but I think the `.html` is probably easiest for most folks (it's what your dad would understand). 

.pull-left[
- photos and videos
- friends
- messages
- security and login information
- other activity
- profile information
- posts
- ads
- about you
- following and followers
]
.pull-right[
- groups
- events
- comments
- search history
- likes and reactions
- location
- pages
- your places
- files
]

???

In the nine months since I deleted my account, I have definitely reached into this data a fair amount. It has helped me verify dates of things that happened, remember jokes between my friends and I, etc. 

---
# Data Facebook does not give you

There were two notable things I wanted from my data that don't come from the data download:

- tagged photos
- friends' birthdays
